The Bill Buzzer

Stage 1: Empathize, Research: -
     As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, environmental degradation and sustainable development, the conservation of electricity has become a major issue to be noticed. A significant portion of the population is unaware about the damage caused to the environment by the increasing demand for electricity, urbanization and technological advancements. The production and consumption of electricity are significant contributors to air pollution, water pollution and emission of greenhouse gasses.
     If we ignore the sustainable practices needed to be done to conserve, the consequences will be deadly for our future generations. Rising energy costs, power outages and increased reliance on non-renewable energy resources will be more and more frequent. Thus, this increased electrical production and consumption will lead to increased environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and decreased air and water quality.
     It is important to address this issue and take required actions to reduce electricity consumption and promote sustainable practices. By making a few minute changes in our daily habits, such as turning our household electrical appliances off when not in use, harnessing renewable energy sources, using energy-efficient and eco-friendly house appliances, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. Government and business individuals must work together to develop and implement policies, technologies and practices that prioritize electricity conservation and sustainable development.

Enhanced Energy Security: Reducing reliance on external energy sources can improve energy security and reduce the risk of power outages.

Stage 3: Ideate:-
    I realized that people where using more electricity than they actually needed, so we developed a program which instructs them to lower their electricity consumption. In this program we ask the users how many electrical appliances they use.

    Then if the usage of appliance is less than 50% than we appreciate them to conserve energy and if it is more than that then we ask them to lower there consumption. Then if someone has air conditioner and if they use then we convey them it use as less as possible

Pseudo Code:
Begin
  Initiate integers and characters which ask the user to input the no. of lights, fans, in their living room. Whether they have tv or an ac. Integer to ask the no. of appliances used. character to ask whether the ac was used.
 if Number of appliances used <= appliances && appliances != 0) {
        if (on_num == appliances && Number of appliances used > 3 && appliances != 0) {
        printf("You should control your electricity consumption as it wastes energy and increases bill!\n");
    else if Number of appliances used >= appliances/2 && Number of appliances used > 2 && Number of appliances used != appliances) {
        printf("Ok, but you could further reduce you consumption.\n");
    else 
        print "Good your electric consumption is as it should be, keep it up!\n");
    else if (appliances == 0)
    if the user's ac is on
        print "Also ensure minimal usage of your air conditioner!"
 End


Stage 4: Prototype: -
    To ensure that the end user is aware of the fact that conservation of energy is necessary, depending upon the ideas in the previous step.
    The program has been written in V.S. Code in the C language. In this program integral variables and character variables are initiated for the user to input the information asked in the code. It is written in if - else if - else structure and nested if structure. For wrong inputs, the “Invalid Output!” message is displayed wherever necessary.
    The prototype asks the user to enter the number of appliances in their living room which include the lightbulbs or tube lights, fans, television, air conditioner etc. After that the program asks the user to enter the number of lights, fans and asks whether the user has a television or has an air conditioner in their living room. It also asks the user whether they used the air conditioner on the day they are using or running the program. 
    In the output, the program informs the user whether they should reduce their usage or keep up with their current usage depending upon some factors:
1)	If they use less appliances than 50% of the existing ones then their usage is proper. This case works in all cases if the number of appliances used is 2.
2)	If they use more than 50% of appliances, then they are asked to reduce as much as possible. This case works only if there are more than 3 appliances in the living room.
3)	Finally, the user is asked immediately to reduce the consumption of electricity if the used appliances are equal to the number of appliances and the number of appliances is more than 3.
    At last the user is also instructed to reduce usage of their air conditioner if they have it and have informed the program that they still use it.

Stage 5: Testing: -
Testing: -
    Before releasing our code to the end user, we tested it to ensure its performance and make it reliable to the end user.
    Our testing process involved checking and validating to identify and fix any bugs or errors. This included trial and error to really make sure that the code ran perfectly and also met the expectations of the end user. By doing so, we were able to deliver code that meets the standards of quality, performance and reliability. To ensure that the code runs flawlessly, we tried every possible input to ensure that all types of outputs are seen without errors or warnings.

India is a country with a diverse population of over 1.3 billion people, and it is facing numerous challenges that affect the mental health and well-being of its citizens.
The need for counselling in India is becoming increasingly important due to education system, lack of mental health resources, social and cultural pressures etc
                     So, to reduce this, we created ‘The Grade Helper’



Stage 2: Define—State Your Users' Needs and Problems: -

 We all know that a student’s career is based on his academic performance. Academic performance is something which may differ from person to person. Students who struggle to excel in their academics often face a lot of issues.

Students who struggle academically often face a multitude of challenges that can impact their academic performance and overall well-being. Some common issues they may encounter include learning difficulties, such as grasping course material or managing their time effectively, which can lead to poor grades and decreased motivation. Additionally, they may struggle with test anxiety, which can cause significant stress and negatively impact their performance on exams. Furthermore, students who are not very good in academics may also face social struggles, such as feeling isolated or struggling to fit in with their peers, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem. These challenges can be overwhelming and may require support from teachers, counselors, or mentors to help students overcome them.


Stage 3: Ideate: - 

As per the project, the code was designed to inform the student of his or her grade according to their roll number. However, my group realised that if any student has got lesser grades, they need some help with that. Therefore, we added the input where we would guide the student by making some changes in their schedule by creating a timetable and ensure proper diet, sleep and exercise. And this code also asks the student to make proper notes and ask their doubts to their teachers. This code also asks the student to ask their doubts to their student representatives and mentors if necessary. Also, this code asks the student whether they need personal counselling and assures hm or her that the counsellor will connect with them soon.


Stage 4: Prototype: - 

Begin
For 1st roll no.
Input subject marks
Output average grade 
Avg = (add all subject marks) / 5
Declare grade (distinction, 1st div, 2nd div, 3rd div or fail)
Ask if student needs guidance (exception: distinction students are just congratulated)
If yes inform how to manage studies and ask if counselling is needed if grade is lower ask if they need counselling and assure that counsellor will connect soon
Thank at the end
Code loops back and enter marks for next roll no. and this loop goes on until 140 students are reached.
End 


Stage 5: TESTING :-


We decided to make program to solve the problem of various students who need counselling.
First of all we made a simple program then we did innovation to that program. There were some errors than with the help of google we rectified that problem.
The code was not working in one of the computer so we sent it to Piyush’s computer where it worked.

STEP 1: Empathize, Research

Understanding electricity tariffs is crucial for both residential and industrial consumers. In Mumbai, the cost of electricity varies significantly based on the type of customer (residential vs. industrial), the time of day, and the season. 

1. Tariff Structure: The tariff is essentially a fee charged for electricity consumption, calculated per unit. Different consumer categories (low tension vs. high tension) reflect varying usage patterns and needs. Low tension (LT) consumers typically include households and small businesses, while high tension (HT) customers are larger industries with higher electricity demands.

2. Factors Affecting Tariffs: Several factors influence electricity tariffs:
   Type of Load: Different devices have different power requirements.
   Power Rating: The wattage of devices determines how much energy they consume.
   Usage Timing: Peak vs. off-peak usage can affect rates.
  Total Energy Used: The cumulative consumption of electricity over a billing period.

By understanding these components, we can better appreciate how industries manage their electricity consumption and costs.

STEP 2: DEFINE: State User Needs

Previously, calculating electricity bills, especially for industries, was a cumbersome process. Users struggled to estimate costs accurately due to the complexity involved in tracking numerous devices and their usage. The need arose for a more straightforward solution—an automated program that could simplify bill calculations, making it easier for users to understand their electricity expenses. 

 STEP 3: Ideate

The primary objective of our program is to calculate the electricity bill for industrial consumers efficiently. Here’s how the program is structured:

1. Input Parameters:
   - The electricity rate (e.g., 5.00 per unit).
   - The number of hours the equipment operates.
   - The quantity of devices such as machines, fans, and lights.
   - The power rating of each device.

2. Functionality: 
   - The program calculates the energy consumption for each device type based on user inputs.
   - It allows users to identify which devices consume the most energy, helping to pinpoint areas for potential energy savings.
   - Finally, the program sums up the total bill across all devices.

Algorithm:
1. Start the Program: Initialization.
2. Input Rate: Gather the cost per unit of electricity.
3. Input Usage Time: Capture how many hours the devices are in operation.
4. Input Device Count: Obtain the number of each device type.
5. Input Power Ratings: Record the wattage for each device.
6. Calculate Units Consumed: Use the formula \((\text{Power consumed} \times \text{Hours}) / 1000\) to find the total energy used.
7. Calculate Individual Bills: Multiply units consumed by the rate to find the bill for each device category.
8. Total Bill Calculation: Sum up the bills from machines, fans, and lights to get the final total.
9. End Program: Finalize calculations and display results.

STEP 4: Prototype

In this stage, we developed a prototype of our program, focusing on the calculation of units consumed using the formula \((\text{Power consumed} \times \text{Hours}) / 1000\). This calculation allows us to convert the power usage from watts to kilowatt-hours (kWh), the standard billing unit for electricity. Then, we multiplied the units consumed by the defined electricity rate to compute the total cost, facilitating easier financial planning for industrial users.

 STEP 5: TESTING

Once the program was developed, we entered the testing phase. Initial challenges included debugging the input handling and ensuring accurate calculations across different scenarios. We utilized online resources, such as forums and documentation, to troubleshoot these issues. 

The testing process involved running various scenarios to validate that the program could handle different combinations of devices and usage times, ensuring it accurately reflected the expected electricity bills. The feedback collected during testing was instrumental in refining the program, making it user-friendly and reliable.

By following these structured steps, we successfully created a program that not only meets user needs but also enhances understanding of electricity costs in industrial settings.
